G - Goal
Correct the syntax errors in TaskEventForm.tsx to properly implement the custom day component for the calendar, which will reduce its vertical spacing.

C - Context
The 5.2 - TaskEventForm.txt file correctly includes the new CustomDayComponent and its associated styles. However, a syntax error was introduced by pasting the component's definition inside the <Calendar> props instead of referencing it. Additionally, the new styles were placed outside the main StyleSheet object, preventing them from being applied.

O - Output
You will provide one updated immersive code artifact:

components/tasks/TaskEventForm.tsx: This file will be corrected to properly reference the CustomDayComponent and include its styles in the main stylesheet.

A - Action
Please modify the components/tasks/TaskEventForm.tsx file by implementing the following actions:

Correct the <Calendar> Component:

Locate the <Calendar /> component in your JSX.

Find the large block of code you pasted inside it that starts with const CustomDayComponent = ... and delete that entire block.

In its place, add a single prop: dayComponent={CustomDayComponent}.

Move the Styles:

Go to the very bottom of the file.

Find the block of styles that starts with dayContainer: { ... }.

Cut this entire block of styles (from dayContainer to the closing },).

Scroll up to the const styles = StyleSheet.create({ ... }); block.

Paste the styles you just cut anywhere inside this main styles object.

Delete any duplicate style definitions that may be left at the bottom of the file.
